<p>Maddy Robinson loves playing the piano, baking, and the bunny that sits outside her doorstep. She grew up in Calgary, Alberta, and even as a kid was interested in piano, so much so that she convinced her parents to buy her a keyboard. Since then, she has been playing the piano for over ten years and won second place in the Calgary Performing Arts Festival in the Grade Nine division of Impressionism. She also could be a super spy, with this as her cover, but you’d never know that.</p>

<p>Miguel first started playing music in elementary school. Thanks to fantastic teachers and mentors such as Lisa Armstrong, Jack Shepard and Kevin Wilms, Miguel has grown as a 
musician and and expanded his musical knowledge. Miguel started self teaching himself 
guitar at an early age and has stayed with it, picking up riffs and songs that interested him. However in grade 7 Miguel began playing trumpet in school bands and continued throughout high school. His involvement included concert band and jazz ensembles. Now out of highschool Miguel still plays and sings whenever he can. He is able to focus on writing his own songs when he has time. Very busy with sail coaching, sail racing and life, Miguel enjoys down time to sit down and play guitar.</p>

<h2>Peter Roman</h2>

<p>Peter Roman was born in Weyburn, Saskatchewan. He moved to Calgary at the age 
of 3 and has grown up there since. He has always loved the game of soccer from a 
young age and still plays it to this day injury permitting. He always liked music since 
he was a kid and in grade 7 decided to join the school band. He selected percussion 
as the instrument he wanted to play. This choice was made because he was never 
good at string instruments and didn’t want to blow into an instrument. Of the 
different instruments he learned to play, the drums were always his favorite. The 
reason was simply because he thought they were cool and playing bells is quite 
difficult to learn. They were so cool to him that in 9th grade he had his first drum set. 
He also continued to play music in high school for two years before leaving due to 
not having time to commit to the program. He still plays music and it is his second 
favorite hobby behind soccer.</p>

<h2>Chathula Adikary</h2>

height="175" />
<p>Born in a foreign country far, far away, Chathula
has always displayed a keen interest in various forms
of music inlcuding rock, metal, funk and most importantly baila.
At the age of 5 Chathula started playing piano, cause his parents 
thought it was the only instrument that ever existed. After moving to
Canada at the age of 11, Chathula soon realised that there are way
more instruments than the piano and began to play guitar. In grade 8, Chathula's music teacher introduced him to the bass guitar, which is kinda like a guitar but bassier.
Since then he has been in love with the bass guitar, and is keenly working on improving 
his slapping, tapping, and popping skills. In addition to music, Chathula enjoys working
with cars, programming computers, biking and cricket. Oh and did I mention, he likes cheesecake.
